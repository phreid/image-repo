# Fall 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge
This is an image repository built for the 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge. The repository has these features:
 - User sign-up, login and logout 
 - "Sell" and "Buy" images
 - Manage price and stock

The app was built with Node.js, express, mongodb, and EJS. 

## Usage
To use the app:
 1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`
 2.  Install MongoDB and start a local server on port 27017. 
 3.  Seed the database with `node seed.js`
 4.  Start the server with `node index.js`
 5.  Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
 6.  To see the user authorization features, create a new user or login with these credential: `username: user1 password: user1`

## Potential Future Features
TESTS! I would have loved to add testing, but just didn't have the time to learn a new testing framework.

In the future I'd like to replace the simple EJS front-end with a more robust solution using React.
